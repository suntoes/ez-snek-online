# ez snek online
Realtime online snake game with websockets using Node.js, MongoDb, Mongoose, Express and Socket.io with Vanilla JS for game logic.

## Usage
```
npm install
npm run dev

Go to localhost:3000
```

## Note
I suppose this doesn't work without a MongoDb Uri, and mine's private. You could try this code out with your own MongoDb Uri, or I could temporary run it through my Replit so <b>hmu if you wanna try</b>
