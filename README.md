# ez snek online 
Realtime online snake game with websockets using Node.js, MongoDb, Mongoose, Express and Socket.io with Vanilla JS for game logic. Has CRUD features for user/hostroom data in MongoDb.

## <a href="https://ez-snek-online.suntoes.repl.co/">Live Demo on Replit</a> (incase it runs)


## Usage
```
npm install
npm run dev

Go to localhost:3000
```

## Note
I suppose this doesn't work without a MongoDb Uri, and mine's private. You could try this code out with your own MongoDb Uri, or I could temporary run it through my Replit so <b>hmu if you wanna try</b>
